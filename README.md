<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

This is a toy python library that lets you obtain the size of any
Hugging Face dataset. For example, we can check the size of
[tglcourse/CelebA-faces-cropped-128](https://huggingface.co/datasets/tglcourse/CelebA-faces-cropped-128)
like so:

``` python
from nbdev_spaces_demo import hfsize 
hfsize("tglcourse/CelebA-faces-cropped-128")
```

    '5.49 GB'

We deploy this function using Gradio and Hugging Face spaces.

## Using nbdev with Gradio

Gradio and Hugging Face spaces is one of the easiest way to create and
host apps. Gradio also allows you to prototype these apps in notebooks,
which is excellent!

We show you step-by-step instructions on how to deploy a Hugging Face
gradio app from a notebook in this example.
